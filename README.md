# DL-Project-
# PNEUMONIA DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING 
An interactive web application built with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow** that detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images.  

This project was developed as part of our **college coursework** to demonstrate how deep learning can be applied in healthcare.
